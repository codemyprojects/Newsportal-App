  1   CHAPTER 3  Underlying Technologies   Exercises  1. We know that D = T × V, where D is the distance, T is the time, and V is the veloc- ity or speed. In other words, T = D / V. We insert the corresponding values to find the time needed for a bit to travel the cable.  3. Assume that the minimum frame size is 65 bytes or 520 bits. We have L = T × R, where L is the length of the frame, T is the time, and the R is the data rate. We can say T = L / R. The time can be calculated as         5. The padding needs to make the size of the data section 46 bytes. If the data received from the upper layer is 42 bytes, we need 46 − 42 = 4 bytes of padding. 7.  a. Similarities:  Each station has an equal right to the medium. Each station senses the medium. b. Differences:  CSMA/CD: A station can send if it senses no signal on the line. CSMA/CA: A station needs to inform other stations that it needs the medium for a specific amount of time.      CSMA/CD: A collision can occur.      CSMA/CA: Collisions are avoided.   T = D / V = (2500 meters) / (200,000,000 meters/second) = 0.0000125 s = 12.5 μs    T = L / R = (520 bits)  /  (10,000,000) bits/second  =  0.000052 s =  52 μs     2   8.
